INSANYCK PROJECT — STRICT RULES

You are working on a production-grade luxury e-commerce called INSANYCK.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- NEVER touch payment, checkout, Stripe, Mercado Pago, webhooks or auth unless explicitly allowed.
- NEVER refactor globally.
- NEVER delete files unless asked.
- NEVER guess which file is in use — always do a pre-flight check first.

WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):
1. First, explain what files are involved (pre-flight).
2. Then, propose a clear patch plan.
3. Only then, generate code.
4. All changes must be minimal and scoped.

CODE QUALITY:
- Next.js Pages Router
- Strict TypeScript
- Tailwind v4 only
- SSR-safe, a11y-safe, no visual regressions
- Respect Museum Edition / INSANYCK Design System

If any rule conflicts:
STOP and ask the user.

LANGUAGE:
- Always respond in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR).

BUNKER (ABSOLUTO):
- Never edit anything under checkout/payments/webhooks/auth unless explicitly allowed.
- If a task mentions Stripe, Mercado Pago, checkout, webhook, auth, middleware, or env vars: STOP and ask for explicit scope + file list.
