# INSANYCK CI + Lighthouse CI - Proof of Function

**Date**: 2025-01-03  
**Engineer**: INSANYCK Staff Engineer via Claude Code

## Pipeline Overview

This document serves as proof of functioning for the INSANYCK CI/CD quality pipeline implementation.

### Components Implemented

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Triggers: Push to any branch + Pull Requests
   - Quality checks: Lint â†’ TypeScript â†’ Build
   - Artifacts: Build traces on failure
   - Status: `CI / build`

2. **Lighthouse CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`)  
   - Triggers: Pull Requests only
   - Performance auditing with PR comments
   - Artifacts: Lighthouse reports (always) + failure traces
   - Status: `Lighthouse CI / lighthouse`

## How to Read Lighthouse Comments on PRs

When you open a pull request, the Lighthouse CI bot will automatically post a comment with:

### 1. **Score Summary**
```
Performance: 85 (+2)  ðŸŸ¢
Accessibility: 94 (0)  ðŸŸ¢  
Best Practices: 91 (-1)  ðŸŸ¡
SEO: 95 (+1)  ðŸŸ¢
```

**Reading the scores**:
- **Number**: Current score percentage
- **(+/-N)**: Change compared to target branch
- **ðŸŸ¢**: Passing (above threshold)
- **ðŸŸ¡**: Warning (close to threshold)  
- **ðŸ”´**: Failing (below threshold)

### 2. **Detailed Metrics**

The comment includes detailed breakdowns for each page tested:
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): Time to first content render
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): Time to largest content element
- **SI** (Speed Index): Visual loading completeness
- **TTI** (Time to Interactive): When page becomes fully interactive
- **TBT** (Total Blocking Time): Main thread blocking time
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): Visual stability metric

### 3. **Report Links**

Each comment includes links to:
- **Full HTML Reports**: Complete Lighthouse audit with recommendations
- **JSON Data**: Raw metrics for programmatic analysis  
- **Temporary Public Storage**: Hosted reports (available for 30 days)

### 4. **Action Items**

The comment may include:
- **Opportunities**: Specific performance improvements with estimated impact
- **Diagnostics**: Issues found with debugging information
- **Passed Audits**: Successfully validated checks

## Pipeline Validation

### Current Status
- âœ… **Lint**: Passes with warnings (non-blocking)
- âœ… **TypeScript**: Zero type errors  
- âœ… **Build**: Production build successful
- âœ… **Lighthouse Config**: 5 URLs tested, 2 runs each
- âœ… **Thresholds**: Performance 80%, A11y 90%, Best Practices 90%, SEO 90%

### Artifacts Available

**On CI Failure**:
- `next-trace`: Next.js build trace files for debugging

**On Lighthouse Run** (always):  
- `lighthouse-ci-results`: Complete HTML and JSON reports

**On Lighthouse Failure**:
- `lighthouse-failure-reports`: Detailed failure analysis

### Environment Safety

Both pipelines use production-like but CI-safe environment:
- Dummy Stripe keys prevent real payments
- Sentry disabled prevents error spam
- Telemetry disabled reduces external calls
- NextAuth uses dummy secrets

## Testing the Pipeline

### To Trigger CI Workflow:
```bash
# Any push triggers CI
git push origin main

# Or create a PR
git checkout -b test/ci-validation  
git push -u origin test/ci-validation
# Open PR via GitHub UI
```

### To Trigger Lighthouse CI:
```bash
# Must create a PR (push alone won't trigger)
git checkout -b test/lighthouse-validation
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger lighthouse ci"
git push -u origin test/lighthouse-validation  
# Open PR via GitHub UI - lighthouse comment appears in ~2-3 minutes
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful PR Flow:
1. **Push commits** â†’ CI workflow starts
2. **CI passes** â†’ Green check mark appears
3. **PR created** â†’ Lighthouse workflow starts  
4. **Lighthouse runs** â†’ Automatic comment posted with scores
5. **Both pass** â†’ PR is ready for review/merge

### Failure Scenarios:
1. **Lint/Type/Build fails** â†’ Red X, download `next-trace` artifact  
2. **Lighthouse fails threshold** â†’ Red X, comment shows failing scores
3. **Flaky lighthouse results** â†’ Re-run workflow, review if consistently failing

## Governance Integration

- **CODEOWNERS**: `@nickchagass` owns all files requiring review
- **Branch Protection**: Ready for GitHub UI setup (see `docs/quality-gates.md`)
- **Status Checks**: Both workflows provide required status checks for PR blocking

## Maintenance Notes

**Pipeline Health Monitoring**:
- Watch for consistent lighthouse failures (may indicate perf regression)
- Monitor CI runtime (should complete in <3 minutes typically)  
- Review artifacts monthly to identify build optimization opportunities

**Configuration Updates**:
- Lighthouse thresholds in `lighthouserc.json`
- CI environment variables in workflow YAML files
- Tested URLs can be modified in `lighthouserc.json`

This pipeline ensures zero-regression deployment with automated quality gates and comprehensive performance monitoring.
